# Obsolescence

This version of GaLity has been re-implemented within GSA (https://github.com/michaelbrownuc/GadgetSetAnalyzer) and is no longer supported. The functionality in this project will be supported as part of GSA from now on. This repository has been left up for informational purposes only.


# What is Gality?

GaLity is an open-source implementation to compute metrics on sets of gadgets which has been developed by Andreas Follner. This particular version has been updated and expanded by Michael D. Brown. This version of gality will calculate the originally proposed metrics for JOP and COP gadgets, and also incorporates some minor bug fixes and code comments.

# How to compile Gality?

## With Eclipse

The easiest way is to import the git project into Eclipse and to let it compile it automatically. 

## Command Line

You can also compile the program on the command line:
```bash
$ cd gality
$ javac -d ./bin/ src/gality/Program.java
```

# How to run Gality?

The first argument is the file containing the set of gadgets generated by [ROPgadget](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/ROPgadget).
The second argument is Gality's output file.

# Eclipse

You can use a "run configuration" to give parameters to gality and then run gality.

# Command Line

```bash
$ ROPgadget --binary /usr/bin/whereis > /tmp/whereis.gadgets
$ java -cp ./bin/ gality.Program /tmp/whereis.gadgets /tmp/whereis.gadgets.metrics
```
